Tests

* Write full unit tests for every new or changed behaviour.

Features
========

* Detect whether started by another process that handles
  daemonisation, such as ‘inetd’, and behave appropriately.

* Allow specification of umask (default: 0000).

* Drop ‘suid’ and ‘sgid’ privileges if set.

* Close all open file handles.

* Default re-open stdin, stdout, stderr to ‘/dev/null’.

* Allow specification of a non-root user and group to drop to, if
  started as ‘root’ (default: no change of user or group).

* Allow specification of PID file name and directory, with standard
  PID file locking behaviour (default: no PID file).

* Allow specification of a syslog service to log as (default: output
  to stdout and stderr, not syslog).

Documentation
=============

* Full docstrings for functions, classes, and modules.

* PEP for adding this library to the standard library.
